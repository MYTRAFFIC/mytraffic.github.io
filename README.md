### Writing your content

To write a new post you need to do the following:

- create your content as a markdown file in the `_posts` directory
- edit the post's metadata (add a main image for your post, you can find great ones on [unsplash.com](https://unsplash.com))
- add your post's images to the `assets/images` directory
- add your author profile to the `_config.yml` file if it is not there yet
